# Ranking
Write a program that __ranks__ candidate-interns, depending on the __points__ from the __interview tasks__ and their __exam results__ in SoftUni. You will receive some lines of __input__ in the format "__{contest}:{password for contest}__" until you receive "__end of contests__". Save that data because __you will need it later__. After that you will receive other type of inputs in format "__{contest}=>{password}=>{username}=>{points}__" until you receive "__end of submissions__". Here is what you need to do:
- Check if the contest is __valid__ (if you received it in the first type of input)
- Check if the __password is correct__ for the given contest
- Save the __user__ with the __contest__ they take part in (__a user can take part in many contests__) and the __points__ the user has in the given contest. If you receive the __same contest__ and the same user, __update__ the points __only__ if the new ones are __more__ than the older ones.
 
At the end you have to print the info for the user with __the most points__ in the format:

"__Best candidate is {user} with total {total points} points.__".

After that print __all students__ ordered by their __names__. For each user, print __each contest__ with the __points in descending order__ in the following format:

"__{user1 name}<br>
\#  {contest1} -> {points}<br>
\#  {contest2} -> {points}<br>
{user2 name}<br>
â€¦__"

## Input
- You will be receiving strings in formats described above, until the appropriate commands, also described above, are given.
## Output
- On the __first__ line print the best user in the format described above. 
- On the __next lines__ print all students ordered as mentioned above in format.
## Constraints
- There will be __no case__ with two equal contests.
- The __strings__ may contain any ASCII character except from (__:, =, >__).
- The __numbers__ will be in range __[0 - 10000]__.
- The __second__ input is always __valid__.
- There will be __no case__ with __2 or more__ users with same total points.
